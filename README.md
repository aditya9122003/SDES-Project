SDES stands for "Safe Directional Evacuation System".

Problem: 
In highly-crowded indoor spaces like malls, there is a possibility of fire outbreak. This type of situations can cause a sense of confusion and panic among the masses. Therefore a need was to devise a safe and fast system, which could direct people to the nearest and safest fire exit in the mall.

To do this, we made a set of Digital Circuits, which would in the light up arrow-LEDs in order to show direction to people.
